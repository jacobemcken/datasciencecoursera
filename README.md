# About your GitHub account

Dear Ashley

I'm writing because I am interested in you GitHub account name. I have started a
small company in Denmark with the name: Full Spectrum.

If your aren't using your account (as it seems from the lack of public activity
anyway), I would like to ask if you would be so kind as to close it down so that
I would be able to register the name.

I would like to use the company to distribute the generic (Open Source)
libraries that I create to a broader audience in the hopes that others will find
them useful.

You will be able to contact me on the email: jacob@emcken.dk

If you wanna snoop a bit on me:

Have a nice day.

Cheers
Jacob
